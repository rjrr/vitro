/**
 * This class stores sets of smart nodes that are considered equivalent and therefore interchangeable for service continuation; whene one sensor in the set fails, any other in that set can take its place.
 * This set of sensors is updated from the UI.
 * The equivalency is independent of specific services or capabilities. (the framework should detect, however, if a node set as equivalent with another node, can't measure temperature (for example), whereas the other one can.
 * The equivalency is a "suggestion" of inter-changeability but the gateway
 * When a service uses the "service continuation" flag, the the VGW should receive in the incoming query, any vectors of equivalency related to the gateway (OR more efficiently) only those vectors of equivalency that include nodes participating in the query/service
 * TODO Adding a new set of equivalent nodes should expand an existing entry if a sensor of the new set already belongs to an equivalency entry. (This could also be done in post-processing, albeit the DB will be cluttered!
 * TODO (CONSIDER) the VGW could also have a way to auto-detect equivalent sensors, but this practically can't work efficiently.
